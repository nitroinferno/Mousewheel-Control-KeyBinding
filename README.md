# OpenMW-MouseWheel-Control-KeyBinding
Lua scripts that allow selection of spells, enchantments and weapons from the press of a key and MouseWheel input 


## DESCRIPTION

This mod will allows you to cycle through weapons and spells by means of a MouseWheel scroll + user defined keybinds for weapons and spells.

The menu also has options to limit scrolling of spells slot to only spells, or default behavior including spells and enchanted items. Additionally there is an option to omit non ring or amulet type enchanted items, for those of us who dislike when gear gets unequipped unintentionally by enchanted clothing/armors.

\*\*\*\* **Important Note** \*\*\*\*
Unbind default camera zoom binding in binding menu which is normally bound to MouseWheel inputs to avoid conflict with weapon or spell scrolling.

v 1.1.1 Updates:
- Added script to enable camera zoom on mousewheel when either weapon or spell scroll key is not pressed.
- Fixed a bug where sound Fx would play when only 1 weapon was in inventory
- Weapon unsheathe sound Fx will no longer play when weapon is not unsheathed.
- Added user setting to automatically ready spells or weapons on keybind + scroll
